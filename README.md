Welcome to my personal repository for data structures and algorithms! This repository serves as my coding playground, where I organize and implement various algorithms and data structures for personal learning and practice. 

## Directory Structure
- **[100_DAYS_OF_CODE](https://github.com/jahnvisahni31/CodeHive/tree/main/100daysofcode):** Code snippets and solutions related to my "100 Days of Code" challenge.
- **[GFG Problems](https://github.com/jahnvisahni31/CodeHive/tree/main/GFG-Problems):** Implementations of algorithms and data structures related to problems on GeeksforGeeks. (Hard, Medium, Easy) 
- **[SQL-50](https://github.com/jahnvisahni31/CodeHive/tree/main/SQL_50):** Code snippets and solutions of most asked problems of SQL (Hard, Medium, Easy)
Feel free to explore the folders and files if you are interested in my coding journey and the solutions I've come up with for different problems. I plan to add more!
